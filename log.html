        The most basic place for this kind of nonsence. I am starting this all over for the third time. I am going to start from 0 and work my way up. I am not sure how this will turn out, but I am okay with failing again if that is what happens. I am going to do my best to post every change that I make to my GitHub with hopes that it will make some progress and I can better follow my growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going to dedicate at least one hour a day to this. For now all of my entries will be put on here until I am able to figure out how to code my on blog for proper posting.
      </p>

        Not going to let anything get in my way. No more excuses. No more feeling sorry for yourself. Get over it. It's your life. Do something with it that will make <b>YOU</b> happy!
