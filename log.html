        The most basic place for this kind of nonsence. I am starting this all over for the third time. I am going to start from 0 and work my way up. I am not sure how this will turn out, but I am okay with failing again if that is what happens. I am going to do my best to post every change that I make to my GitHub with hopes that it will make some progress and I can better follow my growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going to dedicate at least one hour a day to this. For now all of my entries will be put on here until I am able to figure out how to code my on blog for proper posting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not going to let anything get in my way. No more excuses. No more feeling sorry for yourself. Get over it. It's your life. Do something with it that will make <b>YOU</b> happy!

        I was going to get going on Free Code Camp again tonight, but I worked a 15 hour day today including travel time. I am really tired. I am going to pass this evening and make up for it this weekend. I am kind of bummed that I am making an excuse so soon.

        Day one official. Going to review my work and possibly edit any previous work that I am unhappy with. Going to also attempt to reach out to fellow campers to possible find some folks willing to go over my work and correct my short comings.

        The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is something I have to remember to do in the future. These tags must be included at the top of all of my pages. Going to make it a habit to type that out first with my opening and closing &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt;, ect.
      </p>

        I did not get nearly as far as I would have liked in my first hour today. There were several distractions and most of it was jumping around the FCC curriculum. I am not sure this is the best way for me to relearn things. I think I might finish the new things that have been added the last couple of years and then move on to trying to teach myself how to make my blog. I also need to outline the items I want included in my blog so I can make sure to check things off as they are completed. One of the first big things I need to learn is how to make a secure login process.

        Watched an Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href="https://youtu.be/mNDA-o9yJNw" target="_blank">speech</a> today. The main thing that I got out of it was to better prioritize my time. There is 24 hours in a day. I sleep for 6 to 7 of those, drive for 2ish, work 8 to 10 hours, family time for about 2 hours. That leaves me with 3 to 4 hours that I have been wasting. It has been spent watching things that do not help me. Spent playing video games that do not improve me. Spent on the internet getting slightly mad at the world. I can do better. I am not going to say that I should stop spending some time on the things I have been doing, however I need to start prioritizing the things that will help me reach my goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also need to not be afraid to fail. I am one of the people he spoke about who makes a plan b. My plan b always is taking time away from my main goal. This has to stop. So I am going to put this on here. <b>My goal is to finish the Free Code Camp curriculum and get their certification this year</b>. I am then going to keep coding on the things that I want to do in my 3 to 4 hours a day even if I get a job in the industry. This will include making this blog something unique to me regardless if there is a simplier way to get it done with things like wordpress.

        So I finished going over the basic HTML lessons on FCC. I am going to review the CSS lessons tomorrow.

        Started going through FCC's CSS courses. I remember almost all of what I came across today from that. I took a break from it to redo <a href="https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies" target="_blank">Flexbox Zombies</a>. I realzied that I never went through it all. I stopped where it told me to originally at chapter 3, but never resumed it. So today I worked through chapters one and two again for a refersher and will continue it tomorrow. I did incorporate the flexbox stuff that I reviewed today and put it in the blog. Since I have been writing this with the newest entry on the bottom of the page, I used a flex-direction to reverse the column.

        Not a whole lot to report on this today. Was hit hard by some exhaustion today. I am assuming it was brought on by some depression. I am going to work my way through it as best as I can and keep moving forward with this.

        I have jumped around a bit today. Not really much focus. I continued some study of the Flexbox Zombies. Made it through Chapter 3 without much trouble. It gave me a couple of ideas for the layout of this blog that I am going to attempt to implement.
